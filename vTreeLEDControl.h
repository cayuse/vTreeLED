// this list is by no means complete or well thought out, just some ideas
// mode 0:  loop is not called at all.. only the command interpreter this is 'fully host driven mode'
// mode 1:  light is acting as a host, its doing (something) but also broadcasting to its friends
//          at least some kind of sync pulse or maybe its aware of relative locations and is telling them when/what
//          to update
// mode 3:  light is on, light is set to some color, not much else happening
// mode 4:  light is doing some pre-programmed shifting
// mode 5:  same as above with synchronisation inputs
// mode 6:  light is doing some algorithmic shifting
// mode 7:  same as above with synchronization inputs
